**You don’t need a big budget to start designing chips.**

When I first got into VLSI, I remember thinking:

**“How does anyone even afford these tools?”**

It felt like a field reserved for those with access to expensive licenses and high-end setups.

But that’s not the full story.

There’s now a powerful lineup of free, open-source tools that let you explore everything from RTL design to physical layout — right from your laptop.

If you’re serious about learning VLSI on your own terms, there are open source tools for RTL simulation and synthesis like:
### Icarus Verilog + GTKWave– For simulation & waveform analysis
### Yosys – End-to-end synthesis and layout

These tools are free, beginner-friendly, and used in real-world academic and open-source projects.

You don’t need perfect tools — just the right ones to begin.
