## üöÄ [RTL Design And Synthesis Workshop Using Sky130PDK](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/rtl-design-using-verilog-with-sky130-technology/)
Welcome to the RTL Design Workshop ‚Äî a practical learning journey into the world of digital logic design using Verilog. This repository is organized as a multi-day series, with each day featuring guided labs, annotated code, and step-by-step explanations to help you build, simulate, and synthesize real digital circuits from scratch.

### üìò About This Workshop

This hands-on workshop is designed for **students, hobbyists, and early-career engineers** looking to build a strong foundation in digital design using **open-source tools**. You‚Äôll explore the entire flow from writing Verilog code to synthesizing it with the Sky130 PDK.

### üîß What You‚Äôll Learn:

* Writing and simulating RTL designs using **Verilog**
* Running functional simulations with **Icarus Verilog** and visualizing waveforms in **GTKWave**
* Performing logic synthesis with **Yosys** and the **Sky130 open-source process design kit**
* Hands on practice using Linux terminal or open-source FPGA environments
* Understanding core concepts like:

  * Basics of **Verilog Coding**
  * **Testbench creation**
  * **Standard cell libraries and their verilog modules**
  * **D Flip-Flop styles**
  * **Hold and setup time** concepts
  * Basic **optimization techniques**
  * **if-else, case, for, and generate** statements
  * **Gate level Synthesis**
  * **Inferred Latches**
  * **Simulation and Synthesis mismatch**

### üõ†Ô∏è What You‚Äôll Need Before You Start

To get the most out of this workshop, make sure you're comfortable with the following:

* Fundamentals of digital circuits ‚Äî logic gates, flip-flops, muxes, etc.
* Basic command-line usage in a **Linux terminal**
* A working **Linux setup** (or WSL if you're using Windows/macOS)
* Installed tools:

  * `git` for version control
  * `iverilog` for compiling Verilog
  * `gtkwave` for viewing simulation waveforms
  * `yosys` for logic synthesis
  * Any code editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Vim, Nano)

### üìÅWorkshop Structure

The workshop is organized by day, each with a dedicated folder and Readme:

- **Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis** ([Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis/Readme.md](https://github.com/iamakankshaupadhyay/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_in_Verilog_using_SKY130PDK/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Verilog%20RTL%20design%20and%20Synthesis/Readme.md))
- **Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding** ([Hierarchical and Flat Synthesis/Readme.md](https://github.com/iamakankshaupadhyay/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_in_Verilog_using_SKY130PDK/blob/master/Hierarchical%20and%20Flat%20Synthesis/Readme.md)) and ([Synthesis_of_DFF_with_asynchronous_reset/Readme.md](https://github.com/iamakankshaupadhyay/RTL_Design_and_Synthesis_in_Verilog_using_SKY130PDK/blob/master/Synthesis_of_DFF_with_asynchronous_reset/Readme.md))

**You don‚Äôt need a big budget to start designing chips.**

When I first got into VLSI, I remember thinking:

**‚ÄúHow does anyone even afford these tools?‚Äù**

It felt like a field reserved for those with access to expensive licenses and high-end setups.

But that‚Äôs not the full story.

There‚Äôs now a powerful lineup of free, open-source tools that let you explore everything from RTL design to physical layout ‚Äî right from your laptop.

If you‚Äôre serious about learning VLSI on your own terms, there are open source tools for RTL simulation and synthesis like:
1. **Icarus Verilog + GTKWave** ‚Äì For simulation & waveform analysis
2. **Yosys** ‚Äì End-to-end synthesis and layout

These tools are free, beginner-friendly, and used in real-world academic and open-source projects.

You don‚Äôt need perfect tools ‚Äî just the right ones to begin.
