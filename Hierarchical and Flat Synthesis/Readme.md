# üìö Timing Libraries & SKY130 PDK Overview
## üîç What is the SKY130 PDK?
The SKY130 Process Design Kit (PDK) is an open-source toolkit provided by SkyWater Technologies. It is built around a 130nm CMOS fabrication process and includes everything needed for digital and analog IC design ‚Äî including models for timing, power, area, and process variation.

This PDK is widely adopted in open-source silicon design workflows and is supported by tools like Yosys, OpenROAD, and Magic.

## üß† Understanding the Library Naming Convention
One of the key components in synthesis and STA (Static Timing Analysis) is the timing library, typically provided in .lib format. A common example: sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

Let‚Äôs break it down:

| Component | Meaning                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `tt`      | Typical process corner          |
| `025C`    | Temperature at **25¬∞C**         |
| `1v80`    | Core supply voltage = **1.80V** |


This naming convention helps designers select the appropriate library based on process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) conditions.

## üìÇ How to View the .lib File
To inspect the contents of a timing library file (e.g., cell delays, setup/hold times):

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step
üß∞ Step 1: Installing GVim and Viewing .lib Files
GVim is the graphical version of vim, a powerful text editor. You can use it to explore .lib timing library files in the SKY130 PDK.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim-gtk3
```
This installs GVim with GUI support.

üìÇ Step 2: Open the Timing Library File
Use the following command to open the .lib file in GVim:
```
gvim sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
### ‚úÖ Why GVim?
Syntax highlighting for better readability

Easy navigation and search (/keyword)

Lightweight and fast for large files like .lib

# ‚öôÔ∏èHierarchical versus Flat Synthesis

## 1. Hierarchical Synthesis
 Retains the module hierarchy as defined in RTL, synthesizing modules separately.
 
 ###  Synthesis of RTL design (multiple_modules.v) using Yosys tool

### 1. **Start Yosys**

  ```shell
yosys
  ```

### 2. **Read the liberty library**
Library (.lib file) contains standard cells (basic gates, modules etc.) for synthesis.
  ```shell
read_liberty -lib /address_to_your_sky130_file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
  ```

### 3. **Read the Verilog code**
  ```shell
 read_verilog /home/vsduser/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/multiple_modules.v
  ```

### 4. **Synthesize the design**
  ```shell
synth -top multiple_modules
   ```

### 5. **Technology mapping**
  ```shell
abc -liberty /address_to_your_sky130_file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

### 6. **Visualize the gate-level netlist**

```shell
show multiple_modules
```
Mentioning the name of file is necessary, because here three modules are generated.
### 8. **Write and view (in text editor GVim) the gate-level netlist**

  ```shell
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
!gvim multiple_modules_hier.v
   ```
The netlist is illustrated as:

</div>
**Advantages:**
- Faster synthesis time for large designs.
- Improved debugging and analysis due to maintained module boundaries.
- Modular approach, aiding integration with other tools.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cross-module optimizations are limited.
- Reporting can require additional configuration.


## 2. Flattened Synthesis
Merges all modules into a single flat netlist, eliminating hierarchy. The `flatten` command in Yosys collapses the hierarchy, allowing whole-design optimizations.
 ###  Synthesis of RTL design (multiple_modules.v) using Yosys tool

1. **Start Yosys**

  ```shell
yosys
  ```

### 2. **Read the liberty library**
Library (.lib file) contains standard cells (basic gates, modules etc.) for synthesis.
  ```shell
read_liberty -lib /address_to_your_sky130_file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
  ```

### 3. **Read the Verilog code**
  ```shell
 read_verilog /home/vsduser/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/multiple_modules.v
  ```

### 4. **Synthesize the design**
  ```shell
synth -top multiple_modules
   ```

### 5. **Technology mapping**
  ```shell
abc -liberty /address_to_your_sky130_file/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

### 6. **Visualize the gate-level netlist**

```shell
show multiple_modules
```
Mentioning the name of file is necessary, because here three modules are generated.
### 8. **Flatten, write and view (in text editor GVim) the gate-level netlist**

  ```shell
flatten
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
!gvim multiple_modules_hier.v
   ```
The netlist is illustrated as:

**Advantages:**
- Enables aggressive, cross-module optimizations.
- Results in a unified netlist, sometimes simplifying downstream processes.

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer runtime for large designs.
- Loss of hierarchy complicates debugging and reporting.
- Can increase memory usage and netlist complexity.
